## Overview

The Terraform Infrastructure Provisioning for AWS project automates the deployment of essential AWS resources using Terraform, an infrastructure-as-code tool. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting it up, and guidelines for usage and contribution.

## Features
- Automated provisioning of AWS resources including EC2 instances, VPCs, S3 buckets, and security groups.
- Modular and scalable infrastructure setup using Terraform modules.
- Customizable configurations for AWS resources, enabling flexibility and adaptability to different use cases.
   
## Prerequisites
Before using this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd terraform-aws-infrastructure

 2-**Set up AWS credentials:**
 3-Customize Terraform variables:
 Navigate to the variables.tf file in each module directory (ec2_instance, vpc, s3, security_group) and customize the variables as 
 needed.
 4- **Initialize Terraform:**
 terraform init
 5-**Deploy AWS resources:**
 terraform apply
 6-
 **Access deployed resources:**
 Once the deployment is complete, access the AWS Management Console to view and manage the deployed resources.

# Usage

    Customization: Modify Terraform configurations to customize AWS resource settings such as instance types, VPC configurations, 
    and security group rules.
    Scaling: Adjust resource counts and configurations to scale infrastructure up or down based on workload demands.
    Maintenance: Regularly update and review Terraform configurations to ensure consistency and compliance with best practices.
